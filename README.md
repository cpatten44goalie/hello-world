# hello-world
Hello, GitHub world!
I am a middle school (soon to be high school) student in Pennsylvania, USA.
I play ice hockey and I'm a goalie, hence the "goalie" in my name.
My two ideas for possible jobs are Physical Training and Programming, so I figured I'd get into programming early.
My favorite programming things I've done so far is programming robots, and programming my own video game with Alice.
I believe that computers hold lots of potential for creating new possobilities.
Technology is our future, and it's up to me what I will do with that power.
I know I'll be pretty crappy at first, but I have to start somewhere.
Thanks for stopping by! Have a great day!
